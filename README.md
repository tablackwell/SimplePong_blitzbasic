# SimplePong_blitzbasic
A simple pong game made in BlitzBasic for the purpose of instructing my students. It uses the BlitzBasic programming language, using the BlitzPlus IDE. The Blitz IDE is prettttttttty outdated so if you want to mess around with this code I highly recommend you look at one of the alternate IDE's the community has released. Also, in order for the game to run on Modern windows computers, you'll need to enable DirectPlay under legacy features. Controls should be pretty self explanatory. A and Z control the left paddle, UP and DOWN control the right paddle. Its pong.
